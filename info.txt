## Enhanced Web Search Architecture (IMPLEMENTED 2025)

### Intent Detection System
- **QueryIntent Classification**: Analyzes user queries for primary intent (factual, recommendation, comparison, status, planning)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence for web search necessity, temporal/location relevance, personal context
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies locations, time references, topics, and comparison indicators
- **Search Strategy**: Determines priority level and expected source types

### Query Rewriting Engine
- **Context-Aware Enhancement**: Incorporates user preferences, location, and conversation history
- **Strategy Selection**: Direct, expanded, contextual, or comparative rewriting approaches
- **Topic Expansion**: Adds relevant synonyms and related terms for better coverage
- **Search Term Optimization**: Generates ranked search terms for semantic matching

### Semantic Result Filtering
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Relevance, semantic alignment, context fit, and source quality
- **Domain Authority**: Weighted scoring based on source credibility (.gov, .edu, news, etc.)
- **Temporal Relevance**: Prioritizes recent content for time-sensitive queries
- **Source Diversity**: Ensures variety in result types (news, reviews, official, social)

### Memory Reuse System
- **Search Result Caching**: Stores query results with embeddings for similarity matching
- **Smart Cache Lookup**: Uses cosine similarity on hash-based embeddings
- **Adaptive TTL**: Variable cache lifetime based on query type and temporal sensitivity
- **Usage Analytics**: Tracks hit rates, most-used queries, and cache effectiveness

### Context Assembly Engine
- **Token-Aware Assembly**: Combines user profile, memory, web results within token limits
- **Priority-Based Compression**: Preserves most important context when space limited
- **Section Optimization**: Dynamic compression based on relevance and available space
- **Quality Warnings**: Alerts when context is truncated or incomplete

### Fallback & Recovery System
- **Result Quality Analysis**: Detects weak results and suggests improvements
- **Query Refinement**: Provides specific suggestions for better results
- **Clarifying Questions**: Asks targeted questions when context is insufficient  
- **Alternative Sources**: Recommends specific websites or databases for better information

## Current Limitations & Technical Debt (UPDATED)
1. **Embeddings**: Still using hash-based embeddings instead of proper vector embeddings
2. **Token Usage**: Significantly improved but could benefit from transformer-based compression
3. **Web Search**: Now semantic-based with intelligent fallbacks (major improvement)
4. **Context Assembly**: Completely redesigned with smart compression and prioritization  
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error boundaries remain, could be more robust
6. **Performance**: Added caching helps, but could benefit from request deduplication
