## üîç **Intelligent Web Search Triggering**

### **Context-Aware Detection**
The web search now uses intelligent triggering based on:

1. **Critical Keywords** (always trigger):
   - Time-sensitive: "today", "current", "latest", "now", "breaking"
   - Real-time needs: "happening now", "live", "just announced"

2. **Context-Sensitive Keywords** (conditional):
   - Weather: "weather", "temperature", "forecast"
   - Job market: "job market", "hiring", "salary trends"
   - Real estate: "housing market", "rent prices", "home prices"
   - Events: "news", "events", "festivals", "concerts"

3. **Contextual Intelligence**:
   - Recent conversation topics
   - Urgent queries in user history
   - Location-specific discussions
   - Recent successful web searches

### **Enhanced Web Search Logic**
```typescript
needsWebSearch(prompt, {
  recentTopics?: string[];
  urgentQueries?: string[];
  lastWebSearch?: Date;
  userPreferences?: any;
})
```

### **Dynamic Tool Availability**
