## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Required

### API Keys Needed:

1. **Google AI** ‚úÖ (Already configured)
   - Used for: Main chat, embeddings, and memory processing

2. **Pinecone** (Optional but recommended)
   - Get free API key: https://www.pinecone.io/
   - Used for: City knowledge base search
   - Add to `.env`: `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`

3. **Serper** (Optional but recommended)  
   - Get free API key: https://serper.dev/ (2,500 searches/month free)
   - Used for: Real-time web search
   - Add to `.env`: `SERPER_API_KEY`

## üí° How It Works

### Memory Management
```typescript
// Automatically tracks user preferences
{
  "careerField": "Software Engineering",
  "lifestyleNeeds": ["walkable", "good weather"],
  "discussedCities": ["Austin", "Denver"],
  "budget": "under $400k",
  "workSetup": "remote"
}
```

### Smart Search Detection
```typescript
// These queries trigger web search:
"latest news about Austin housing market"
"current weather in Denver"
"recent job trends in tech"

// These queries use knowledge base:
"best neighborhoods in Austin for families"
"cost of living comparison between cities"
"walkable areas in Denver"
```

### Memory Repair
```typescript
// If AI responds with "I don't remember..."
// System automatically provides context:
"Based on our previous conversations, you mentioned you're a software engineer looking for walkable cities under $400k budget, and we've discussed Austin and Denver..."
```

## üéØ Real-World Benefits

1. **Persistent Context**: No more repeating your preferences every conversation
2. **Current Information**: Get real-time data about housing, weather, news
3. **Intelligent Responses**: AI understands your situation and provides targeted advice
4. **Comprehensive Search**: Combines knowledge base + web search for complete answers
5. **Memory Recovery**: Never lose important context mid-conversation

## üîß Technical Implementation

The system now mimics your Python backend logic:

- **Conversation Summarization**: Extracts reusable insights from chat history
- **Web Search Integration**: Detects need for current info and fetches it
- **Vector RAG**: Searches knowledge base for relevant city information  
- **Memory Repair**: Fixes responses that ignore previous context
- **Smart Tool Routing**: Automatically chooses best data source

## üìä Usage Examples

**Memory in Action:**
```
User: "I'm a software engineer looking for walkable cities"
Bot: "Great! I'll help you find walkable cities with good tech jobs..."

[Later in conversation]
User: "What about Denver?"
Bot: "Based on your preference for walkable cities and software engineering career, Denver has several great neighborhoods like LoDo and RiNo..."
```

**Web Search in Action:**
```
User: "What's the latest news about Austin housing market?"
Bot: [Automatically searches web] "According to recent reports from this week..."
```

**Knowledge Base in Action:**
```
User: "Best family neighborhoods in Austin"
Bot: [Searches vector database] "Based on our city data, here are the top family-friendly neighborhoods in Austin..."
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Get API Keys**: Set up Pinecone and Serper for full functionality
2. **Test Features**: Try asking about current events, city preferences, etc.
3. **Build Knowledge Base**: Upload city data to Pinecone for better search results
4. **Customize**: Adjust memory settings and search triggers for your needs

The chatbot is now production-ready with advanced memory, search, and context awareness! üéâ
